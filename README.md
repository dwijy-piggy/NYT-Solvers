This repository contains cheats for some games on the New York Times website. 

Instructions for using scripts:

1. Copy the script you want to use
2. Bookmark a random page
3. Edit the URL of the bookmark to the copied code
4. Give the bookmark a descriptive name (so that you know what it does)
5. Execute the script by clicking on the bookmark that contains it

Most of these scripts only give you the answer, so you have to type the given answers yourself.
