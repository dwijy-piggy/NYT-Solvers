# NYT-cheats
This repository contains cheats for some games on the New York Times website. 

Instructions for using scripts:

1. Copy the script you want to use
2. Bookmark a random page
3. Edit the URL of the bookmark to the copied code
4. Give the bookmark a descriptive name (so that you know what it does)
5. Execute the script by clicking on the bookmark that contains it

If you are on a computer, you can also paste these scripts directly into the console in your browser's developer tools

The cheats in the folder titled "Automated" automatically input the answers for you

The cheats in the folder titled "Other" represent the answers as text somewhere on the page, and you must input them manually
